# PAR-11 vs. HiHo-9 Scoring for Squash
Monte-carlo simulation to observe statistics for contrasting the point-a-rally scoring system to the hand-in hand-out scoring system debate in 2009 by the MA Squash.

The following code assumes a simple parametric distribution when computing the probabilities of winning a rally. The script plays 5000 games between two players and varies the probability of winning a rally.


### How do I get set up? ###

* Run m-file script with Matlab.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Fork or branch this repository
* I invite others to program more complex distributions or to make the simulations more realistic.
